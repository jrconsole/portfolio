              People are more capable than we know. 
              In order to enable people to reach their fullest potential they need an environment with the following attributes:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Detailed experimentation/ specialization</h4>
                  People need time to dive into a subject that interests them.
                  They need minimal distractions as they learn that subject.
                  They need to have the freedom to learn whatever concepts they feel they need at that moment, as 
                  they are the best judge of their relative levels of comprehension.
                  They need focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Inspiration</h4>
                  People need to be attracted to a subject to learn it properly. 
                  Either because the subject itself is interesting, or they are interested in the impact that knowledge will have on their life.
                  The best form of inspiration comes from entertainment. 
                  To remain inspired, people need a mentor; someone who has mastered the subject in question and uses it to improve their own life.
                  A community for that subject allows for a person to gain a sense of beloging and shared purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Flexibility</h4>
                  As each person is different, people need several sources to choose from when learning a subject.
                  Some people's favorite teacher is the worst for someone else.
                  People need to be able to change their direction whenever they want. 
                  Every subject should be learned with focus until a decision is made to change subject. 
                  This allows for an optimum pace of iteration toward a life-long career.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Goals</h4>
                  People need an objective in order to remain focused, something they will use their education for.
                  People should create their own hero story in which their education plays a crucial part in saving the world.
                  Everything a person learns should support the objectives they set for themselves.

              Engineers and artists make the world. 
              Everything else is a "necessary" evil, and we should work to make that evil as small as possible.
