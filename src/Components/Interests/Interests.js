      <h3>Forward - Upward - Outward</h3>
      <p>A better future will be brought about by each of us devoting our life to the causes we care about most. 
        Problems are solved and life is improved not through arguing and engaging in conflict, but by imagining a better world and engineering solutions to whatever obstacles stand in the way.
        To enable each person to <span>focus</span> on their purpose, and avoid the distractions that are all around us, I have selected the following areas to <span>focus</span> my efforts:

              People are more capable than we know. 
              In order to enable people to reach their fullest potential, we need to create an environment with the following attributes:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Detailed experimentation/ specialization</h4>
                  People need time to dive into a subject that interests them.
                  They need minimal distractions as they learn that subject.
                  They need to have the freedom to learn whatever concepts they feel they need at that moment, as 
                  they are the best judge of their relative levels of comprehension.
                  They need focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Inspiration</h4>
                  People need to be attracted to a subject to learn it properly. 
                  Either because the subject itself is interesting, or they are interested in the impact that knowledge will have on their life.
                  The best form of inspiration comes from entertainment. 
                  To remain inspired, people need a mentor; someone who has mastered the subject in question and uses it to improve their own life.
                  A community for that subject allows for a person to gain a sense of beloging and shared purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Flexibility</h4>
                  As each person is different, people need several sources to choose from when learning a subject.
                  Some people's favorite teacher is the worst for someone else.
                  People need the ability to change their direction whenever they want. 
                  Every subject should be learned with focus until a decision is made to change subject. 
                  This allows for an optimum pace of iteration toward a life-long career.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Goals</h4>
                  People need an objective in order to remain focused, something they will use their education for.
                  People should create their own hero story in which their education plays a crucial part in saving the world.
                  Everything a person learns should support the objectives they set for themselves.
                </li>

              Engineers and artists make the world. 
              Everything else is a "necessary" evil, and we should work to make that evil as small as possible.
              A one-man-army who can imagine a product, build it, test it, and deploy it has the most streamlined process that can be. 
              It allows for every piece of the development process to be done with a cohesive vision and unparalleled level of focus. 
              Of course, its impossible to scale such a system; and since we would like to help as many people as we can with a useful product, we begin to specialize.
              With each level of scale, we add layers of management between the engineers/artists and the consumers. 
              These layers dilute the creator's vision and introduce inefficiency, as middle managers neither ideate new products nor build the products imagined.
              <br/> <br/>
              Artists and engineers make the world.
              Artists target aspects of the human experience ripe for improvement, and imagine a better world,
              while engineers use the resources and tools at their disposal to bring that world about.
              Sometimes they are the same person, which allows for a cohesive vision and unparalleled level of focus.
              Sometimes they are different people in an organization, which allows for specialization and an increase in available expertise and productive output.
              But this specialization begins to introduce inefficiency once people begin to specialize in neither ideation nor engineering, but in management.
              Middle managers are currently a "necessary" evil in most companies, and we should work to make that evil as insignificant as possible through systems and software that allow for the following:
              <br/><br/>
              specialization - In most cases, one person cannot possess enough knowledge to operate every stage of a product's development, especially with the speed and quality to match demand.
              vision - maintain creators vision
              user feedback - gather user feedback and incorporate into product while maintaining vision
              <br/><br/>
              Artists and engineers make the world, while layers of middle management are a "necessary" evil in a growing company.
              We should work to make that evil as insignificant as possible through systems and software that allow for the following:
